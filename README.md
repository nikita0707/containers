# ft_containers

This is the ft_containers project from the new cursus.

You have to reimplement the following C++ containers:
- [x] Vector ([std::vector])
- [x] Map ([std::map])
- [x] Stack ([std::stack])

STL is not allowed. That means you cannot you cannot use `<iterator>` or even `<utility>`.

My map/set implementations all use the Red-Black Tree as the underlying data structure.
Red-Black Tree implemented in RBTree.hpp file in this repository.

Bonus:
- [x] Set ([std::set])

This implementation comes with a large set of tests in the test directory.
